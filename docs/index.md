# Testing MakeCode and Codal

On this website, you will find the information required to reproduce our results gathered for the paper entitled "MakeCode and Codal: Intuitive and Efficient Embedded Systems Programming for Education" using the micro:bit. After reading the entirety of this page, at the top there is a drop down menu labelled `tests` which provides links to detailed documents on the tests we conducted for each environment using the micro:bit.

## Physical requirements

- Must have a micro:bit
- Must have a copy of our debian virtual machine with testing environment.
- Must have an oscilloscope available.

## Required ability
- Must be competent with debian, and terminal.
- Must have some experience with an oscilloscope, or are willing to learn how to use one!
- Understand how to use a serial terminal.

## Test procedure

Firstly, a virtual machine needs to be downloaded, steps to do this are described in the section entitled 'Obtaining the virtual machine' listed below.

Once you have obtained the virtual machine, the root directory for testing (`evaluators`) is arranged in the following form:

- `codal` contains the codal build environment which you will use to conduct codal tests.
- `docs` contains the documentation for tests and this overview document. We provide this website for convenience.
- `espruino` contains the espruino interpretter used when testing espruino.
- `makecode` contains a modified copy of the executable web editor that can be run locally.
- `tests` contains all of the tests, grouped by each environment, their use is described in the `docs` folder. e.g. `docs/codal.md` describes all tests that are contained in `tests/codal/*`.

Tests either use a serial terminal to validate output, or use an oscilloscope to measure waveforms, in either case the setup pictured below should be adequate for both tests:

The micro:bit is connected to a PC over USB (top of the micro:bit), which also exposes a serial port for a PC to connect to for serial output from the micro:bit. The scope has one probe lead connected to channel one, this probe lead connects to the micro:bit's ground pin (far right of the micro:bit), and samples pin P1 (yellow cable connected to the micro:bit). All tests use pin P1, so no reconfiguration of this setup will be required.

For information on how to use an oscilloscope we recommend this [sparkfun tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope/anatomy-of-an-o-scope#horizontal).

## What is a micro:bit?

The [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) is a small embedded computer designed for computer science education, MakeCode and Codal were initially designed for the micro:bit, evolving and supporting other devices over time.

## Obtaining the virtual machine

The virtual machine is contained here in [google drive](some.url.eventually), freely downloadable by anyone.

The virtual machine contains a folder named `evaluators` which is placed in the home directory of the lctes user. The username for the virtual machine is: `lctes` and the password is: `lctes2018`. To become super user, type su in a terminal, and enter the same password (`lctes2018`).

Once logged in, and in the `evaluators` directory, you can view the tests as markdown files in the `docs` directory. Alternately, these markdown documents can also be viewed on the web by running `mkdocs serve` in the evaluators folder, or browsing to: https://lancaster-university.github.io/lctes-artefact-evaluation/ which is a pre-built, and hosted version produced from the same source.

We recommend that you add the micro:bit usb device using the machine settings tab in virtual box as shown in the image below:

We also have a convenience script for mounting a shared folder between the host and the vm. Simply create a shared folder named `lctes-vm-dir` and run `sh mount.sh` (contained in `evaluators`) as a super user to mount the shared folder to vb-share (also contained in `evaluators`). Shared folder creation in VirtualBox is pictured below:
