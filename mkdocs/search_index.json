We provide this website for convenience.\n\n\nespruino\n contains the espruino interpretter used when testing espruino.\n\n\nmakecode\n contains a modified copy of the executable web editor that can be run locally.\n\n\ntests\n contains all of the tests, grouped by each environment, their use is described in the \ndocs\n folder. e.g. \ndocs/codal.md\n describes all tests that are contained in \ntests/codal/*\n.\n\n\n\n\nTests either use a serial terminal to validate output, or use an oscilloscope to measure waveforms, in either case the setup pictured below should be adequate for both tests:\n\n\n\n\nThe micro:bit is connected to a PC over USB (top of the micro:bit), which also exposes a serial port for a PC to connect to for serial output from the micro:bit. When connected, the micro:bit will mount the VM at \n/media/lctes/MICROBIT\n so that it can be programmed -- it can be accessed using the FileVault application or through the terminal.

All tests use pin P1, so no reconfiguration of this setup will be required. For information on how to use an oscilloscope we recommend this \nsparkfun tutorial\n.\n\n\nWe provide minicom installed on the virtual machine to observe serial results. From a terminal run \nminicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200\n to communicate with the microbit. \n-D\n specifies the device, and \n-b\n specifies the baud rate.

To quit minicom, press \nctrl + a\n followed by \nq\n.\n\n\nWhat is a micro:bit?\n\n\nThe \nmicro:bit\n is a small embedded computer designed for computer science education, MakeCode and Codal were initially designed for the micro:bit, evolving and supporting other devices over time.\n\n\nObtaining the virtual machine\n\n\nThe virtual machine is contained here in \ngoogle drive\n, freely downloadable by anyone. You will need to install the \nVM VirtualBox Extension Pack\n.\n\n\nThe virtual machine contains a folder named \nevaluators\n which is placed in the home directory of the lctes user. The username for the virtual machine is: \nlctes\n and the password is: \nlctes2018\n. To become super user, type su in a terminal, and enter the same password (\nlctes2018\n).\n\n\nOnce logged in, and in the \nevaluators\n directory, you can view the tests as markdown files in the \ndocs\n directory. Alternately, these markdown documents can also be viewed on the web by running \nmkdocs serve\n in the evaluators folder, or browsing to: https://lancaster-university.github.io/lctes-artefact-evaluation/ which is a pre-built, and hosted version produced from the same source.\n\n\nWe recommend that you add the micro:bit usb device using the machine settings tab in virtual box as shown in the image below:\n\n\n\n\nWe also have a convenience script for mounting a shared folder between the host and the vm. Simply create a shared folder named \nlctes-vm-dir\n and run \nsh mount.sh\n (contained in \nevaluators\n) as a super user to mount the shared folder to vb-share (also contained in \nevaluators\n).
